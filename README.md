## Lue et al. Warming, parasitoid success and diet breadth

Data and analysis scripts for the manuscript Lue et al. 2025 *Warming reduces parasitoid success and narrows their diet breadth*.

Using these data and scripts, we investigated how success of consumer and resource species development, consumer diet breadth and redundancy of top-down control are impacted by experimental warming and cooling. We measured the outcomes of 28 interactions involving *Drosophila* species and their parasitoids within a tropical rainforest food web at ambient (24°C), warming (28°C), and cooling (20°C) temperatures. The interactions involved seven *Drosophila* host species, three larval parasitoids, and one pupal parasitoid. We used 50 *Drosophila* eggs per vial, the vials served as replicates. We also measured outcome of control vials unexposed to parasitoids.

We analyzed parasitism success, degree of infestation, and host developmental success using Bayesian analysis. We analyzed parasitoid diet breadth using simple linear models. See the manuscript for detailed methods.
